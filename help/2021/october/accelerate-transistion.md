# Accelerating Transition to Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service

Get to know more about how to leverage the Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service code refactoring tools to accelerate your transition journey to Cloud Service by making your existing content (package structure, indexes, Adobe Experience Manager Asset processing workflows, dispatcher configurations) Cloud Service compatible via automation.

In this session, we will show how we can use the aio-cli-plugin-Adobe Experience Manager-cloud-service-migration (our Adobe I/O Extensible Command Line Interface (CLI) based NodeJS plugin which provides an unified experience for these code refactoring tools and minimizes the overhead of installation and setup), to easily install the and use the code refactoring tools.

We hope to help people understand the best practices around using the code refactoring tools, by showing the execution of the tools on real Adobe Experience Manager customer code base.
