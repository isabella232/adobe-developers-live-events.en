# A glance into a Commerce Developer’s Toolkit

When it comes to delivering successful outcomes on flexible and therefore complex frameworks like Adobe Commerce and Magento open source it is imperative that development teams use the right tools for the job. In this talk we will walk through tools I have found useful in my career as a Magento developer. We will cover topics such as local development setup, debugging and profiling tools, leveraging New Relic to your advantage in a production environment, testing etc. We will look at some examples of how these tools can make the life of developers, in an already complex environment, easier!
